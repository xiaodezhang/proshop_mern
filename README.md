It's been a long time since I worked in GitHub for my own hobby. Things changed during the time. I was married, moved from the big city to the city my parents and friends lived. I am 30, an awkward age cause I was more a loser than I should be.
That's an inspiring summary. I completely understood my situation. So just let it go, Ok?

The store should be implemented in a short time. I prepared to change my insist to the software tec or something.
现在列出一些需要完成的内容：
1. 增加markdown的支持，商品添加markdown格式的商品描述文件
2. 增加本土商品的内容
3. 是否增加快递进度跟踪的功能？
4. 一些UI的local修改
5. 商品评价的添加功能修改
6. 支付接口
7. 部署

事实上，整个网站的的工具链都是新的！我之前是用python写网站的，前端的react, redux也没有接触过，分布式的数据库mongoose没有使用过，已经花了大约两个星期来学习这些新工具的知识。到底能做到何种程度，我们拭目以待！
